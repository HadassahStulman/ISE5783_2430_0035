**Image Renderer Graphic Project**<br>

**Overview:** <br>
This project is an advanced image rendering engine designed to create highly realistic scenes with comprehensive graphical and physical effects. The rendered scenes include intricate details such as transparency, shadows, colors, light effects, sparkle, shininess, and diverse material properties. The final output is a JPEG image captured from a specified camera angle, produced from the pixel matrix.

**Project Structure:**<br>
The project is organized into several packages, each responsible for different aspects of the rendering process: <br>
geometries: Defines geometric shapes and objects in the scene.<br>
lighting: Manages different light sources and their effects on the scene.<br>
primitives: Contains basic data structures and utilities used throughout the project.<br>
renderer: Handles the rendering process, converting the scene into a pixel matrix.<br>
scene: Manages the composition of objects, lights, and camera settings in the scene.<br>
test: Contains tests to ensure the correctness and performance of the rendering engine.<br>

**Features:** <br>
Complete Lighting and Physics: Supports color, shadows, reflections, transparency, ect. <br>
Geometric Shapes: Handles various geometries like spheres and planes. <br>
Image improvement: anti-aliasing <br>
Enhances performance: Multi-threading.<br>

**Development Approach:** <br>
This project was developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD), ensuring a high level of code quality and reliability. Each feature and functionality was accompanied by rigorous tests written prior to the implementation, ensuring correctness and preventing regressions. The project also incorporates refactoring and agile methodologies to promote continuous improvement and adaptability
